To create a Python code for calculating and comparing the efficiencies of converting energy to hydrogen using metal hydrides and liquid ammonia, as well as to fossil fuels used for energy storage, you can use the following steps:

First, import the necessary modules for data manipulation and mathematical calculations, such as pandas and numpy.
 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
Next, load the data on the energy required to produce hydrogen using metal hydrides and liquid ammonia, as well as the energy content of hydrogen in these forms, into a pandas dataframe.
 
df = pd.read_csv('energy_data.csv')
Use the pandas dataframe to calculate the energy efficiency of hydrogen production using metal hydrides and liquid ammonia.
 
df['Metal Hydride Efficiency'] = df['Hydrogen Energy Content (kWh/kg)'] / df['Energy to Produce Hydrogen (kWh/kg)']
df['Ammonia Efficiency'] = df['Hydrogen Energy Content (kWh/L)'] / df['Energy to Produce Hydrogen (kWh/L)']
Use the same method to calculate the energy efficiency of fossil fuels used for energy storage, such as gasoline and diesel.
 
df['Gasoline Efficiency'] = df['Hydrogen Energy Content (kWh/L)'] / df['Energy to Produce Gasoline (kWh/L)']
df['Diesel Efficiency'] = df['Hydrogen Energy Content (kWh/L)'] / df['Energy to Produce Diesel (kWh/L)']
Compare the energy efficiency of hydrogen production using metal hydrides and liquid ammonia to the energy efficiency of fossil fuels using the data in the dataframe.
 
print(df[['Metal Hydride Efficiency', 'Ammonia Efficiency', 'Gasoline Efficiency', 'Diesel Efficiency']])
This code will use the data on the energy required to produce hydrogen using metal hydrides and liquid ammonia, as well as the energy content of hydrogen, to calculate the energy efficiency of these methods. It will also calculate the energy efficiency of fossil fuels used for energy storage and compare them to the hydrogen production methods. You can customize the code by changing the data, the calculation methods, and the comparison methods to suit your specific needs.
