use AI techniques to extract data from web pages:

Using a pre-trained machine learning model to extract structured data from unstructured web pages:
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from transformers import pipeline

# Use a pre-trained machine learning model to extract structured data from an unstructured web page
extractor = pipeline("ner")

# Fetch the web page
url = "https://www.example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# Extract structured data from the web page using the pre-trained model
output = extractor(soup.text)

# Extract the entities from the model's output
entities = [{"text": x.text, "label": x.label_} for x in output[0]["entities"]]

print(entities)
Using reinforcement learning to train an agent to navigate and extract data from a website
Copy code
import gym
import gym_web_scraper

# Create an environment for the web scraper
env = gym.make("WebScraper-v0")

# Train the agent using reinforcement learning
agent = DQNAgent(state_size=env.observation_space.shape[0], action_size=env.action_space.n)

for episode in range(1, EPISODES+1):
    state = env.reset()
    for time in range(5000):
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state
        if done:
            print("episode: {}/{}, score: {}, e: {:.2}"
                  .format(episode, EPISODES, time, agent.epsilon))
            break
    if len(agent.memory) > batch_size:
        agent.replay(batch_size)
