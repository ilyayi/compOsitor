To create a code for a content-picking algorithm with typical parameters used for social media feed generation, you can follow these steps:

First, import the necessary modules for data manipulation and machine learning, such as pandas and scikit-learn.
 
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
Next, load the data on user preferences, behaviors, and content into a pandas dataframe. This data may include information on the pages and profiles that users follow, the content that they engage with, and the timing and relevance of the content.
 
df = pd.read_csv('user_data.csv')
Use the pandas dataframe to clean and preprocess the data, such as by imputing missing values and normalizing the data.
 
df = df.fillna(df.mean())
df_scaled = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler().fit_transform(df)
Use the TfidfVectorizer and NearestNeighbors algorithms from scikit-learn to create a content-picking algorithm.
 
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Content'])
nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5, algorithm='auto').fit(X)
Use the content-picking algorithm to recommend content to a user based on their preferences and behaviors.
 
user_data = df[df['User']=='John']
user_vec = vectorizer.transform(user_data['Content'])
recommendations = nbrs.kneighbors(user_vec)
This code will use the data on user preferences and behaviors to create a content-picking algorithm that uses the TfidfVectorizer and NearestNeighbors algorithms from scikit-learn. The algorithm will recommend content to a user
